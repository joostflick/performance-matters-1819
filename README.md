## Description

I made a web app from scratch that displays a list of insult possibilities. It combines the randomuser API and the trumpquotes API into a well thought out personal insult.

## Interaction

The user finds a list of possible insults on the homepage (name + insult). After clicking on the desired combination they will be able to look at a more detailed overview of the insultee. This overview states the e-mail, phone number and location (using the google maps API) to highlight the different ways to contact this person.

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties 🌠 -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

## Optimalization done so far:

- Minifying my ejs, javascript and html files
- Optimizing the google font by selfhosting it and swapping fonts once it has been loaded
- Turning on brotli compression (best performance on quality 4)

<!-- How about a license here? 📜 (or is it a licence?) 🤷 -->
